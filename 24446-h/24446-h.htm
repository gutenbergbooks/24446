    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to have no privacy at all?&rdquo; demanded the Governor irritably as the
      orderly again tapped at the open door and announced another visitor. &ldquo;Who
      is he and what does he want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. John Corwell, your Excellency, master of the cutter <i>Ceres</i>,
      from the South Seas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor's brows relaxed somewhat. &ldquo;Let him come in in ten minutes,
      Cleary, but tell him at the same time that I am very tired&mdash;too tired
      to listen unless he has something of importance to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day had indeed been a most tiring one to the worthy Governor of the
      colony of New South Wales, just then struggling weakly in its infancy, and
      only emerging from the horrors of actual starvation, caused by the utter
      neglect of the Home authorities to send out further supplies of
      provisions. Prisoners of both sexes came in plenty, but brought nothing to
      eat with them; the military officers who should have helped him in his
      arduous labours were secretly plotting against him, and their spare time&mdash;and
      they had plenty&mdash;was devoted to writing letters home to highly-placed
      personages imploring them to induce the Government to break up the
      settlement and not &ldquo;waste the health and lives of even these abandoned
      convicts in trying to found a colony in the most awful and hideous desert
      the eye of man had ever seen, a place which can never be useful to man and
      is accursed by God.&rdquo; But the Governor took no heed. Mutiny and discontent
      he had fought in his silent, determined way as he fought grim famine,
      sparing himself nothing, toiling from dawn till dark, listening to
      complaints, remedying abuses, punishing with swift severity those who
      deserved it, and yet always preserving the same cold, unbending dignity of
      manner which covered a highly-sensitive and deeply sympathetic nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on this particular day, fatigue, the intense heat, which had
      prevailed, a violent quarrel between the intriguing major commanding the
      marines, and many other lesser worries, had been almost more than he could
      bear, so it may well be imagined that he was more inclined for rest than
      talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten, twenty minutes, and then the thin, spare figure raised itself wearily
      from the rude sofa. He must see his visitor. He had promised to do so, and
      the sooner it was over the better. He called to the orderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Mr.&mdash;Corwell you said?&mdash;to come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A heavy step sounded on the bare floor, and one ot the finest specimens of
      manhood Governor Arthur Phillip had ever seen in all his long naval career
      stood before him and saluted. There was something so pleasant and yet so
      manly in the handsome, cleanshaven and deeply-bronzed face, that the
      Governor was at once attracted to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be seated, Mr. Corwell,&rdquo; he said in his low, yet clear tones. &ldquo;I am very
      tired, so you must not keep me long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, your Excellency. But I thought, sir, that you would prefer
      to hear the report of my voyage personally. I have discovered a
      magnificent harbour north of the Solomon Islands, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! And so you came to me. Very sensible, very sensible of you. I am
      obliged to you, sir. Tell me all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, your Excellency; but I regret I have intruded on you this
      evening. Perhaps, sir, you will permit me to call again to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not at all,&rdquo; was the energetic reply. I am always ready to hear
      anything of this nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that, sir, for the masters of the <i>Breckenbridge</i> and another
      transport told me that you were most anxious to learn of any discoveries
      in the Pacific Islands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, sir. I am looking forward to hear from them and from the
      masters of other transports which I am inducing to follow the whale
      fishery on their return voyage to England <i>via</i> Batavia. But so far I
      have heard nothing from any one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Encouraged and pleased at the Governor's manner, the master of the <i>Ceres</i>
      at once produced a roughly executed plan and a detailed written
      description of the harbour, which, he asserted with confidence, was one of
      the finest in that part of the Pacific. A broad, deep stream of water ran
      from the lofty range of mountains which traversed the island north and
      south and fell into a spacious bay, on the shores of which was a large and
      populous native village, whose inhabitants had treated Cornell and the few
      men of his ship's company with considerable kindness, furnishing them not
      only with wood and water, but an ample supply of fresh provisions as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the two weeks that the <i>Ceres</i> lay at anchor, Corwell and two
      or three of his hands unhesitatingly trusted themselves among the natives,
      who escorted them inland and around the coast. Everywhere was evidence of
      the extraordinary fertility of the island, which, in the vicinity of the
      seashore, was highly cultivated, each family's plantation being enclosed
      by stone fences, while their houses were strongly built and neatly
      constructed. The broad belt of the slopes of the mountains were covered
      with magnificent timber, which Corwell believed to be teak, equal in
      quality to any he had seen in the East Indies, and which he said could be
      easily brought down to the seashore for shipment owing to there being
      several other large streams beside the one on whose banks the principal
      village was built.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor was much interested, and complimented the young seaman on the
      manner in which he had written out his description of the place and his
      observations on the character and customs of the inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such information as you have given me, Mr. Corwell, is always valuable,
      and I give you my best thanks. I wish I could do more; and had I the
      means, men, and money to spare I should send a vessel there and to other
      islands in the vicinity to make further examination, for I believe that
      from those islands to the northward we can obtain invaluable food supplies
      in the future. The winds are more favourable for making a quick voyage
      there and back than they are to those groups to the eastward; but,&rdquo; and
      here he sighed, &ldquo;our condition is such that I fear it will be many years
      ere His Majesty will consent to such an undertaking. But much may be done
      at private cost&mdash;perhaps in the near future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man remained silent for a moment or two; then with some
      hesitation he said, as he took a small paper packet from his coat pocket
      and handed it to the Governor, &ldquo;Will your Excellency look at this and tell
      me what it is. I&mdash;I imagine it is pure gold, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gold, gold!&rdquo; and something like a frown contracted the Governor's pale
      brows; &ldquo;ever since the settlement was formed I've been pestered with tales
      of gold, and a pretty expense it has run me into sending parties out to
      search for it. Why, only six months ago a rascally prisoner gulled one of
      my officers into letting him lead an expedition into the bush&mdash;the
      fellow had filed down a brass bolt&mdash;&rdquo; he looked up and caught sight
      of the dark flush which had suddenly suffused his visitor's face&mdash;&ldquo;but
      I do not for a moment imagine you are playing upon my credulity, Mr.
      Corwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He untied the string and opened the packet, and in an instant an
      exclamation of astonishment and pleasure escaped as he saw that the folds
      of paper held quite three ounces of bright and flaky water-worn gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This certainly <i>is</i> gold, sir. May I ask where you obtained it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made the voyage to Sydney Cove to tell your Excellency of two
      discoveries&mdash;one was of the fine harbour, the other was of this gold,
      which my wife (who is a native of Ternate) and myself ourselves washed out
      of the bed of a small stream; the natives helped us, but attached not the
      slightest value to our discovery. In fact, sir, they assured us as well as
      they could that much more was to be had in every river on the island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife was it, then, or yourself, who first recognised what it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did, sir. She has seen much of it in the hands of the Bugis and Arab
      traders in her native country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor moved his slender forefinger to and fro amid the shining,
      heavy particles, then he pondered deeply for some minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me frankly, Mr. Corwell&mdash;why did you make a long voyage to this
      settlement to tell <i>me</i> of your discovery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the hope, sir, that you would advise and perhaps assist me. My crew
      are Malays and Chinese and would have murdered me if they knew what I
      knew. Will your Excellency tell me the proper course to pursue so that I
      may be protected in my discovery? I am a poor man, though my ship is my
      own, but she is old and leaky and must undergo heavy repairs before she
      leaves Sydney Cove again; my present crew I wish to replace by half a
      dozen respectable Englishmen, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor shook his head. &ldquo;I will do all I can to help you, but I
      cannot provide you with men. The island which you have visited may have
      been discovered and taken possession of by France, two of whose exploring
      ships were in these seas a few years ago, and even if that is not the case
      I could not take possession of them for His Majesty, as I have no
      commissioned officer to spare to undertake such a duty. Yet, if such an
      officer were available, Mr. Corwell, I would be strongly tempted to send
      him with you, hoist the British flag, and then urge the Home Government to
      confirm my action and secure to you the right, subject to the King's
      royalties, to work these gold deposits. But I am powerless&mdash;much as I
      wish to aid you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of disappointment clouded the young captain's handsome features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would your Excellency permit me to endeavour to find three or four seamen
      myself? There is a transport ready to sail for England, and I may be able
      to get some men from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it. Unless you revealed the object of your voyage&mdash;which
      would be exceedingly foolish of you&mdash;you could not induce them to
      make a voyage in such a small vessel as yours to islands inhabited mostly
      by ferocious savages. But this much I can and will do for you. I will
      direct Captain Hunter of the <i>Sirius</i>, the only King's ship I have
      here, to set his carpenters to work on your vessel as soon as ever you
      careen her; I will supply you at my own private cost with arms and
      ammunition and a new suit of sails. Provisions I cannot give you&mdash;God
      knows we want them badly enough ourselves, although we are not now in such
      a bad plight as we were ten months ago. Yet for all that I may be able to
      get you a cask or two of beef.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is most generous of you, sir. I will not, however, take the beef,
      your Excellency. But for the sails and the repairs to my poor little
      vessel I thank you, sir, most heartily and sincerely. And I pledge you my
      word of honour, as well as giving you my written bond, that I will redeem
      my obligations to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you fail I shall be content, for I well know that it will be no
      fault of yours. But stay, Mr. Corwell; I must have one condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You too must pledge me your honour that you will not reveal the secret of
      your discovery of gold to any one in the settlement. This I do not demand&mdash;I
      ask it as a favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the Governor took him, guardedly enough, into his confidence. With a
      thousand convicts, most of them utter ruffians, guarded by a scanty force
      or marines, the news of gold having been found would, he was sure, have a
      disastrous effect, and lead to open revolt. The few small merchant ships
      which were in port were partly manned by convict seamen, and there was
      every likelihood of them being seized by gangs of desperate criminals,
      fired with the idea of reaching the golden island. Already a party of
      convicts had escaped with the mad idea of walking to China, which they
      believed was only separated from Australia by a large river which existed
      a few hundred miles to the northward of the settlement. Some of them died
      of thirst, others were slaughtered by the blacks, and the wounded and
      exhausted survivors were glad to make their way back again to their
      gaolers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornell listened intently, and gave his promise readily. Then he rose to
      go, and the Governor held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Cornell. I must see you again before you sail.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      One evening, three weeks later&mdash;so vigorously had the carpenter's
      mates from the old frigate <i>Sirius</i> got through their work&mdash;the
      <i>Ceres</i> was ready for sea. She was to sail on the following morning,
      and Corwell, having just returned from the shore, where he had been to say
      goodbye to the kind-hearted Governor, was pacing the deck with his wife,
      his smiling face and eager tones showing that he was well pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had reason to be pleased, for unusual luck had attended him. Not only
      had his ship been thoroughly and efficiently repaired, but he had replaced
      six of his untrustworthy Malays by four good, sturdy British seamen, one
      of whom he had appointed mate. These men had arrived at Sydney Cove in a
      transport a few days after his interview with the Governor; the transport
      had been condemned, and Corwell, much to his delight, found that out of
      her crew of thirty, four were willing to come with him on what he
      cautiously described as a &ldquo;voyage of venture to the South Seas.&rdquo; All of
      them had served in the navy, and the captain of the transport and his
      officers gave them excellent characters for sobriety and seamanship. Out
      of the sixty or seventy pounds which still remained to him he had given
      them a substantial advance, and the cheerful manner in which they turned
      to and helped the carpenters from the frigate convinced him that he had
      secured decent, reliable men, to whom he thought he could reveal the real
      object of his voyage later on.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Two years before Cornell had been mate of a &ldquo;country&rdquo; ship employed in
      trading between Calcutta and the Moluccas. The Ternate agent of the owners
      of the ship was an Englishman named Leighton, a widower with one daughter,
      whose mother had died when the girl was fifteen. With this man the young
      officer struck up a friendship, and before six months had passed he was
      the acknowledged suitor of Mary Leighton, with whom he had fallen in love
      at first sight, and who quickly responded to his affection. She was then
      twenty-two years of age, tall and fair, with dark hazel eyes, like her
      English mother, and possessed of such indomitable spirit and courage that
      her father often laughingly declared it was she, and not he, who really
      managed the business which he controlled.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she really did much to help him; she knew his weak, vacillating, and
      speculative nature would long since have left them penniless had he not
      yielded to her advice and protests on many occasions, Generous and
      extravagantly hospitable, he spent his money lavishly, and had squandered
      two or three fortunes in wild business ventures in the Indian Seas instead
      of saving one. Latterly, however, he had been more careful, and when
      Corwell had made his acquaintance he had two vessels&mdash;a barque and a
      brig&mdash;both of which were very profitably engaged in the Manila-China
      trade, and he was now sanguine or mending his broken fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isolated as were father and daughter from the advantages of constant
      intercourse with European society, the duty of educating the girl was a
      task of love to her remaining parent, who, before he entered &ldquo;John
      Company's&rdquo; service, had travelled much in Europe. Yet, devoted as he was
      to her, and looking forward with some dread to the coming loneliness of
      life which would be his when she married, he cheerfully gave his consent
      to her union with John Cornell, for whom he had conceived a strong liking,
      and who, he knew, would make her a good husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were married at Batavia, to which port they were accompanied by Mr.
      Leighton, who, during the voyage, had pressed Corwell to leave his then
      employment and join him in a venture which had occupied his mind for the
      past year. This was to despatch either the barque or brig, laden with
      trade goods, to the Society Islands in the South Pacific, to barter for
      coconut oil and pearl shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leighton was certain that there was a fortune awaiting the man who entered
      upon the venture, and his arguments so convinced the young man that he
      consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arrival at Batavia they found there the officers and crew of a
      shipwrecked English vessel, and one of the former eagerly took Corwell's
      place as chief mate, his captain offering no objection. A few weeks after
      Mr. Leighton hired the <i>Ceres</i> to take himself, his daughter, and her
      husband back to Ternate, eager to begin the work of fitting out one of his
      vessels for the voyage that was to bring them fortune. He, it was
      arranged, was to remain at Ternate, Mary was to sail with her husband to
      the South Seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a terrible shock awaited them. As the <i>Ceres</i> sailed up to her
      anchorage before Mr. Leighton's house, his Chinese clerk came on board
      with the news that the barque had foundered in a typhoon, and the brig had
      been plundered and burnt by pirates within a few miles of Canton. The
      unfortunate man gave one last appealing look at his daughter and then fell
      on the deck at her feet He never spoke again, and died in a few hours.
      When his affairs came to be settled up, it was found that, after paying
      his debts, there was less than four hundred pounds left&mdash;a sum little
      more than that which Corwell had managed to save out of his own wages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Jack,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;'Tis little enough, but yet 'tis enough.
      And, Jack, let us go away from here. I should not care now to meet any of
      the people father knew in his prosperity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cornell kissed his wife, and then they at once discussed the future. Half
      an hour later he had bought the <i>Ceres</i> from her captain (who was
      also the owner), paid him his money and taken possession. Before the week
      was out he had bought all the trade goods he could afford to pay for,
      shipped a crew of Malays and Chinese, and, with Mary by his side, watched
      Ternate sink astern as the <i>Ceres</i> began her long voyage to the South
      Seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a three weeks' voyage along the northern and eastern shores of New
      Guinea the <i>Ceres</i> came to an anchor in the harbour which Cornell had
      described to the Governor. The rest of his story, up to the time of his
      arrival in Sydney Cove, the reader knows. *****
    </p>
    <p>
      Steadily northward under cloudless skies the high-pooped, bluff-bowed
      little vessel had sailed, favoured by leading winds nearly all the way,
      for four-and-twenty days, when, on the morning of the twenty-fifth,
      Corwell, who had been up aloft scanning the blue loom of a lofty island
      which lay right ahead, descended to the deck with a smiling face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not only the island itself, Mary, but with this breeze we have a
      clear run for the big village in the bay; I can see the spur on the
      southern side quite clearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so glad, Jack, dear. And how you have worried and fumed for the past
      three days!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feared we had got too far to the westward, my girl,&rdquo; he said. Then
      telling the mate to keep away a couple of points, he went below to pore
      over the plan of the harbour, a copy of which had been taken by the
      Governor, As he studied it his wife's fingers passed lovingly through and
      through his curly locks. He looked up, put his arm around her waist, and
      swung her to a seat on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Mary, I can tell the men now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure you can! The sooner you take them into your confidence the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corwell nodded. During the voyage he had watched the mate and three white
      seamen keenly, and was thoroughly satisfied with them. The remainder of
      the crew&mdash;three Manila men and two Penang Malays&mdash;did their duty
      well enough, but both he and his wife knew from long experience that such
      people were not to be trusted when their avarice was aroused. He resolved,
      therefore, to rely entirely upon his white crew and the natives of the
      island to help him in obtaining the gold. Yet, as he could not possibly
      keep the operations a secret from the five men he distrusted, he decided,
      as a safeguard against their possible and dangerous ill-will, to promise
      them double wages from the day he found that gold was to be obtained in
      payable quantities. As for the mate and three other white men, they should
      have one-fifth of all the gold won between them, he keeping the remaining
      four-fifths for himself and wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his head up the companion-way and called to the man whom he had
      appointed mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come below, Mallett, and bring Totten, Harris, and Sam with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wondering what was the matter the four men came into the cabin. As soon as
      they were standing together at the head of the little table, the captain's
      wife went quietly on deck to see that none of the coloured crew came aft
      to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, men,&rdquo; said Corwell, &ldquo;I have something important to tell you. I
      believe I can trust you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then in as few words as possible he told them the object of the voyage and
      his intentions towards them. At first they seemed somewhat incredulous,
      but when they were shown some of the gold their doubts vanished, and they
      one and all swore to be honest and true to him and to obey him faithfully
      whether afloat or ashore, in fair or evil fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his scanty store of liquor the captain took a bottle of rum, and they
      drank to their future success; then Corwell shook each man's hand and sent
      him on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before dusk the <i>Ceres</i> ran in and dropped her clumsy,
      wooden-stocked anchor in the crystal-clear water, a few cables' length
      away from the village. As the natives recognised her a chorus of welcoming
      shouts and cries pealed from the shore from five hundred dusky-hued
      throats.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      A blazing, tropic sun shone in mid-heaven upon the motionless waters of
      the deep, land-locked bay in which the Ceres lay, with top-mast struck and
      awnings spread fore and aft. A quarter of a mile away was the beach,
      girdled with its thick belt of coco-palms whose fronds hung limp and hot
      in the windless air as if gasping for breath. Here and there, among the
      long line of white, lime-washed canoes, drawn up on the sand, snowy white
      and blue cranes stalked to and fro seeking for the small thin-shelled
      soldier crabs burrowing under the loose <i>débris</i> of leaves and fallen
      palm-branches to escape the heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few yards back from the level of high-water mark clustered the houses of
      the native village, built on both sides of the bright, fast-flowing stream
      which here, as it debouched into the sea, was wide and shallow, showing a
      bottom composed of rounded black stones alternating with rocky bars. Along
      the grassless banks, worn smooth by the constant tread of naked feet, grew
      tall many-hued crotons, planted and carefully tended by their native
      owners, and shielded from the rays of the sun by the ever-present
      coco-palms. From either side of the bank, looking westward towards the
      forest, there was a clear stretch of water half a mile in length, then the
      river was hidden from view, for in its course from the mountains through
      the heavily-jungled littoral it took many bends and twists, sometimes
      running swiftly over rocky, gravelly beds, sometimes flowing noiselessly
      through deep, muddy-bottomed pools and dank, steamy swamps, the haunt of
      the silent, dreaded alligator.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of the straight stretch of water of which I have spoken there
      was on the left-hand bank of the river an open grassy sward, surrounded by
      clumps of areca and coco-palms, and in the centre stood a large house,
      built by native hands, but showing by various external signs that it was
      tenanted by people other than the wild inhabitants of the island. Just in
      front of the house, and surrounded by a number of canoes, the boat
      belonging to the <i>Ceres</i> was moored to the bank, and under a long
      open-sided, palm-thatched shed, were a number of brown-skinned naked
      savages, some lying sleeping, others squatting on their hams,
      energetically chewing betel nut.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they talked and chewed and spat out the scarlet juice through their
      hideous red lips and coaly black teeth, a canoe, paddled by two natives
      and steered by Mallet, the mate of the <i>Ceres</i>, came up the river.
      The instant it was seen a chorus of yells arose from the natives in the
      long hut, and Mary Corwell came to the open doorway of the house and
      looked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wake up, wake up, Jack!&rdquo; she cried, turning her face inwards over her
      graceful shoulder, &ldquo;here is Mallet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice awoke her husband, who in an instant sprang from his couch and
      joined her, just as Mallet&mdash;a short, square-built man of fifty&mdash;stepped
      out of the canoe and walked briskly towards them, wiping his broad, honest
      face with a blue cotton handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come inside, Mallet. 'Tis a bit cooler in here. I'm sorry I sent you down
      to the ship on such a day as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mallet laughed good-naturedly. &ldquo;I didn't mind it, sir, though 'tis a
      powerful hot day, and the natives are all lying asleep in their huts; they
      can't understand why us works as we do in the sun. Lord, sir! How I should
      like to see old Kingsdown and Walmer Castle to-day, all a-white with snow.
      I was born at Deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Cornell brought the old seaman a young coconut to drink, and her
      husband added a little rum; Mallet tossed it off and then sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, the ship is all right, and those chaps aboard seem content
      enough. But I'm afeared that the worms are a-getting into her although she
      is moored right abreast of the river. So I took it on me to tell Totten
      and Harris to stay aboard whilst I came back to ask you if it wouldn't be
      best for us to bring her right in to the fresh water, and moor her here,
      right abreast o' the house. That'll kill any worms as has got into her
      timbers. And we can tow her in the day after to-morrow, when there will be
      a big tide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did quite right, Mallet. Very likely the worms have got into her
      timbers in spite of her being abreast of the river's mouth. I should have
      thought of this before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Jack,&rdquo; said his wife, with a smile, &ldquo;we have thought too much of our
      gold-getting and too little of the poor old <i>Ceres</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shall think more of her now, Mary. And as the rains will be on us
      in a few days&mdash;so the natives say&mdash;and we can do no more work
      for three months, I think it will be as well for us to sail the <i>Ceres</i>
      over to that chain of lagoon islands about thirty miles from here. I fear
      to remain here during the wet season, on account of the fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After further discussion it was decided that Jack and Mallet, with some
      natives, should make an early start in the morning for their mining camp,
      six miles away, at the foot of the range, and do a long, last day's work,
      returning to the house on the following day. Meanwhile a message was to be
      sent to Harris and Totten to bring the vessel into the creek as soon as
      the tide served, which would be in forty-eight hours. Then, whilst she lay
      for a week in the fresh water, so as to kill the suspected <i>teredo
      navalis</i> worms, which Mallet feared had attacked her, she was to be
      made ready for the short voyage of thirty miles over to a cluster of
      islands enclosing a spacious lagoon, where Corwell intended to beach her
      till the rainy season was over, when he would return to work a very
      promising stream in another locality. Already he and his men, aided by the
      natives, had, in the four months that had passed since they arrived, won
      nearly five hundred ounces of gold, crude as were their appliances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;I think that, as you will be away all day and
      night, to-morrow I shall go on board and see what I can do. I'll make the
      men turn to and give the cabin a thorough overhauling. Marawa, the chiefs
      wife, has given me a lot of sleeping-mats, and I shall throw those old
      horrible flock mattresses overboard, and we shall have nice clean mats
      instead to lie on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      At daylight Mallet aroused the natives who were to accompany him and the
      captain, and then told off two of them to make the boat ready for Mrs.
      Corwell. Then he returned to the house and called out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boat is ready, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I, Mallet,&rdquo; replied Mary, tying on her old-fashioned sun-hood. Then
      she turned to her husband. &ldquo;Jack, darling, this will be the very first
      time in our married life that I have ever slept away from you, and it
      shall be the last, too. But I <i>do</i> want to surprise you when you see
      our cabin again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her lips up to him and kissed him half a dozen times. &ldquo;There,
      that's a good-night and good morning three times over. Now I'm ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corwell and Mallet walked down to the boat with her and saw her get in.
      She kissed her hand to them and in a few minutes was out of sight.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      A light, cool breeze, which had set in at daylight, was blowing when Mary
      Corwell boarded the <i>Ceres</i>. Totten and Harris met her at the
      gangway, caps in hand. Poor Sam, their former shipmate, had died of fever
      a month before. They were delighted to hear that she intended to remain on
      board, and Harris at once told Miguel, the scoundrelly-faced Manila cook,
      to get breakfast ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you must have your breakfast with me,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;and after that you
      must obey <i>my</i> orders. I am to be captain to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      As she and the two seamen sat aft under the awning, at their breakfast,
      Selak, the leading Malay, and his fellows squatted on the fore-hatch and
      talked in whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell thee,&rdquo; said Selak, &ldquo;that I have seen it. On the evening of the day
      when the man Sam died and was buried, I was sitting outside the house. It
      was dark, and the Tuan Korwal thought I had returned to the ship. I crept
      near and listened. They were speaking of what should be done with the dead
      man's share of the gold. Then I looked through the cave side of the house,
      and&mdash;dost remember that white basin of thine, Miguel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Manila man nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The white woman, at a sign from her husband, went into the inner room and
      brought it out and placed it on the table. It was full to the brim with
      gold! and there was more in a bag!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His listeners drew nearer to him, their dark eyes gleaming with avarice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the Tuan said, 'None of Sam's gold will I or my wife touch. Let it
      be divided among you three. It is but fair.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They talked again, and then Mallet said to the Tuan, 'Captain, it shall
      be as you wish. But let it all go together till the time comes for thee to
      give us our share.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I watched the white woman take the basin and the bag, put them into a
      box, and place the box in a hole in the ground in her sleeping-room. Then
      I came away, for my heart was on fire with the wrong that hath been done
      to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet and peered round the corner of the galley. Mary and
      the two seamen were eating very leisurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three of them are here now and will sleep aboard to-night. God hath given
      them into our hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what of the other two?&mdash;they are strong men,&rdquo; asked a wizen,
      monkey-faced Malay, nicknamed Nakoda (the captain).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! What is a giant if he sleeps and a kriss is swept across his throat,
      or a spear is thrust into his back from behind? They, too, shall die as
      quickly as these who sit near us. Now listen. But sit thou out on the
      deck, Miguel, so that thou canst warn us if either of those accursed dogs
      approach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cook obeyed him silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>This</i> it is to be. To-night these three here shall die in their
      sleep, silently and without a sound. Then we, all but thou, Nakoda, shall
      take the boat and go to the house. Both the Tuan and Mallet sleep heavily,
      and&rdquo;&mdash;he drew his hand swiftly across his tawny throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; queried Nakoda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then the gold&mdash;the gold, or our share of which we have been
      robbed&mdash;is ours, and the ship is ours, and I, Selak, will guide ye
      all to Dobbo in the Aru Islands, where we shall be safe, and become great
      men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; muttered another man, &ldquo;what if these black sons of Shaitan here of
      the Island turn upon us after we have slain the white men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Selak laughed scornfully. &ldquo;The sound of a gun terrifies them. They are
      cowards, and will not seek to interfere with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Night had fallen. The two white seamen, tired out with their day's work,
      had spread their mats on the poop, and were sound in slumber. Below in the
      cabin, the captain's wife lay reading by the light of a lamp; and Selak,
      standing in the waist, could see its faint reflection shining through the
      cabin door, which opened on to the main deck. Sitting on the fore-deck,
      with their hands clutching their knives, his companions watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the light was lowered, and Mary closed her eyes and slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Malay waited patiently. One by one the remaining native fires on the
      shore went out; and, presently, a chill gust of air swept down from the
      mountains, and looking shoreward he saw that the sky to the eastward was
      quickly darkening and hiding the stars&mdash;a heavy downpour of rain was
      near.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew his kriss from its tortoiseshell sheath and felt the edge, made a
      gesture to the crouching tigers for'ard, and then stepped lightly along
      the deck to the open cabin door; the other four crept after him, then
      stopped and waited&mdash;for less than a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint, choking cry came from the cabin, and then Selak came out, his
      kriss streaming with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is done,&rdquo; he whispered, and pointing to the poop he sprang up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, there! what's the matter?&rdquo; cried Totten, who had heard the feint cry;
      and then, too late, he drew his pistol from his belt and fired&mdash;as
      Selak's kriss plunged into his chest. Poor Harris was slaughtered ere he
      had opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spurning Totten's body with his naked foot, Selak cursed it. &ldquo;Accursed
      Christian dog! Would I could bring thee to life so that I might kill thee
      again!&rdquo; Then, as he heard the rushing hum of the coming rain squall, and
      saw that the shore was hidden from view, as if a solid wall of white stone
      had suddenly arisen between it and the ship, he grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! what does it matter? Had it been a cannon instead of a pistol it
      could scarce have been heard on the shore in such a din.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ordering the bodies of the two seamen to be thrown overboard, Selak, the
      most courageous, entered the cabin, took a couple of muskets from the
      rack, and some powder and ball from the mate's berth, and returning to his
      followers, bade them bring the boat alongside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw the woman after them,&rdquo; he cried to Nakoda, as the boat pushed off
      into the darkness, just as the hissing rain began. &ldquo;We shall return ere it
      is dawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nakoda would have sprung over the side after the boat, but he feared the
      sharks even more than Selak's kriss; so running for'ard, he crept into his
      bunk and lay there, too terrified to move.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Mallet and Corwell, with the natives, worked hard till near sunset, and
      then ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nearly five ounces in that lot, Mallet,&rdquo; said the captain,
      pointing to two buckets of wash-dirt. &ldquo;Let us have a bathe, and then get
      something to eat before it is too dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The natives say we ought to get back to the house, sir, instead of
      sleeping here tonight. They say a heavy storm is coming on, and we'll be
      washed out of the camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mallet I don't want to stay here, I can assure you. Tell them
      to hurry up, then. Get the shovels and other gear, and let us start as
      quickly as possible. It will take us a good three hours to get back to the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By sunset they started, walking in single file along the narrow, dangerous
      mountain-path, a false step on which meant a fall of hundreds of feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-way down, the storm overtook them, but guided by the surefooted
      natives they pressed steadily on, gained the level ground, and at last
      reached the house about ten o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that we have come so far we might as well go on board and give my
      wife a surprise,&rdquo; said Corwell to Mallet. &ldquo;Look, the rain is taking off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for long, sir. But if we start at once we may get aboard afore it
      starts again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two willing natives, wet and shivering as they were, quickly baled out a
      canoe, and in a few minutes they were off, paddling down towards the sea.
      But scarce had they gone a few hundred yards when another sudden downpour
      of rain blotted out everything around them. But the natives paddled
      steadily on amid the deafening roar; the river was wide, and there was no
      danger of striking anything harder than the hanging branch of a tree or
      the soft banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I heard voices just now,&rdquo; shouted Mallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Natives been out fishing,&rdquo; replied Corwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the canoe shot out through the mouth of the river into the open bay the
      rain ceased as suddenly as it began, and the <i>Ceres</i> loomed up right
      ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't hail them, Mallet. Let us go aboard quietly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They clambered up the side, the two natives following, and, wet and
      dripping, entered the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corwell stepped to the swinging lamp, which burnt dimly, and pricked up
      the wick. His wife seemed to be sound asleep on the cushioned transom
      locker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;wake up, dearest. We&mdash;&mdash; ... Oh my
      God,Mallet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sprang to her side, and kneeling beside the still figure, placed his
      hand on the blood-stained bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead! Dead! Murdered!&rdquo; He rose to his feet, and stared wildly at Mallet,
      swayed to and fro, and then fell heavily forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the two natives stood at the cabin door, gazing in wondering horror at
      the scene, they heard a splash. Nakoda had jumped overboard and was
      swimming ashore.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Long before dawn the native war-drums began to beat, and when Selak and
      his fellow-murderers reached the mouth of the river they ran into a fleet
      of canoes which waited for them. They fought like the tigers they were,
      but were soon overcome and made prisoners, tied hand and foot, and carried
      ashore to the &ldquo;House of the Young Men.&rdquo; The gold was taken care of by the
      chief, who brought it on board to Corwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do these men die?&rdquo; he asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; replied Corwell huskily; &ldquo;to-day, after I have buried my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On a little island just within the barrier reef, she was laid to rest,
      with the never-ending cry of the surf for her requiem.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sunset, Corwell and Mallet left the ship and landed at the village, and
      as their feet touched the sand the war-drums broke out with deafening
      clamour. They each carried a cutlass, and walked quickly through the
      thronging natives to the &ldquo;House of the Young Men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring them out,&rdquo; said Corwell hoarsely to the chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one Selak and his fellow-prisoners were brought out and placed on
      their feet, the bonds that held them were cut, and their hands seized and
      held widely apart. And then Corwell and Mallet thrust their cutlasses
      through the cruel hearts.

    <h2>
      POISONOUS FISH OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Many years ago I was sent with a wrecking party of native seamen to take
      possession of a Swedish barque which had gone ashore on the reef of one of
      the Marshall Islands, in the North Pacific. My employers, who had bought
      the vessel for £100, were in hopes that she might possibly be floated,
      patched up, and brought to Sydney. However, on arriving at the island I
      found that she was hopelessly bilged, so we at once set to work to strip
      her of everything of value, especially her copper, which was new. It was
      during these operations that I made acquaintance with both poisonous and
      stinging fish. There were not more than sixty or seventy natives living on
      the island, and some of these, as soon as we anchored in the lagoon, asked
      me to caution my own natives&mdash;who came from various other Pacific
      islands&mdash;not to eat any fish they might catch in the lagoon until
      each one had been examined by a local man. I followed their injunction,
      and for two or three weeks all went well; then came trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had brought down with me from Sydney a white carpenter&mdash;one of the
      most obstinate, cross-grained old fellows that ever trod a deck, but an
      excellent workman if humoured a little. At his own request he lived on
      board the wrecked barque, instead of taking up his quarters on shore in
      the native village with the rest of the wrecking party. One evening as I
      was returning from the shore to the schooner&mdash;I always slept on board&mdash;I
      saw the old man fishing from the waist of the wreck, for it was high tide,
      and there was ten feet of water around the ship. I saw him excitedly haul
      in a good-sized fish, and, hailing him, inquired how many he had caught,
      and if he were sure they were not poisonous? He replied that he had caught
      five, and that &ldquo;there was nothin' the matter with them.&rdquo; Knowing what a
      self-willed, ignorant man he was, I thought I should have a look at the
      fish and satisfy myself; so I ran the boat alongside and clambered on
      board, followed by two of my native crew. The moment we opened the fishes'
      mouths and looked down their throats we saw the infallible sign which
      denoted their highly poisonous condition&mdash;a colouring of bright
      orange with thin reddish-brown streaks. The old fellow grumbled
      excessively when I told him to throw them overboard, and then somewhat
      annoyed me by saying that all the talk about them being unsafe was bunkum.
      He had, he said, caught and eaten just the same kind of fish at Vavau, in
      the Tonga Islands, time and time again. It was no use arguing with such a
      creature, so, after again warning him not to eat any fish of any kind
      unless the natives &ldquo;passed&rdquo; them as non-poisonous, I left him and went on
      board my own vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had supper rather later than usual that evening, and, as the mate and
      myself were smoking on deck about nine o'clock, we heard four shots in
      rapid succession fired from the wreck. Knowing that something was wrong, I
      called a couple of hands, and in a few minutes was pulled on board, where
      I found the old carpenter lying writhing in agony, his features presenting
      a truly shocking and terrifying appearance. His revolver lay on the deck
      near him&mdash;he had fired it to bring assistance. I need not here
      describe the peculiarly drastic remedies adopted by the natives to save
      the man's life. They at first thought the case was a hopeless one, but by
      daylight the patient was out of danger. He was never able to turn to again
      as long as we were on the island, and suffered from the effects of the
      fish for quite two or three years. He had, he afterwards told me, made up
      his mind to eat some of the fish that evening to show me that he was right
      and I was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks after this incident myself and a native lad named Viri, who
      was one of our crew and always my companion in fishing or shooting
      excursions, went across the lagoon to some low sandy islets, where we were
      pretty sure of getting a turtle or two. Viri's father and mother were
      Samoans, but he had been born on Nassau Island, a lonely spot in the South
      Pacific, where he had lived till he was thirteen years of age. He was now
      fifteen, and a smarter, more cheerful, more intelligent native boy I had
      never met.
    </p>
    <p>
      His knowledge of bird and fish life was a never-ending source of pleasure
      and instruction to me, and the late Earl of Pembroke and Sir William
      Flower would have delighted in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dead low tide when we reached the islets, so taking our spears with
      us we set out along the reef to look for turtle in the many deep and
      winding pools which broke up the surface of the reef. After searching for
      some time together without success, Viri left me and went off towards the
      sea, I keeping to the inner side of the lagoon. Presently in a shallow
      pool about ten feet in circumference I espied a small but exceedingly
      beautiful fish. It was about four inches in length, and two and a half
      inches in depth, and as it kept perfectly still I had time to admire its
      brilliant hues&mdash;blue and yellow-banded sides with fins and tail
      tipped with vivid crimson spots. Around the eyes were a number of dark
      yellowish or orange-coloured rings, and the eyes themselves were large,
      bright, and staring. It displayed no alarm at my presence, but presently
      swam slowly to the side of the pool and disappeared under the coral ledge.
      I determined to catch and examine the creature, and in a few minutes I
      discovered it resting in such a position that I could grasp it with my
      hand. I did so, and seizing it firmly by the back and belly, whipped it up
      out of the water, but not before I felt several sharp pricks from its
      fins. Holding it so as to study it closely, I suddenly dropped it in
      disgust, as strange violent pains shot through my hand. In another two
      minutes they had so increased in their intensity that I became alarmed and
      shouted to Viri to come back. Certainly not more than five or ten minutes
      elapsed before he was with me; to me it seemed ages, for by this time the
      pain was excruciating. A look at the fish told him nothing; he had never
      seen one like it before. How I managed to get back to the schooner and
      live through the next five or six hours of agony I cannot tell. Twice I
      fainted, and at times became delirious. The natives could do nothing for
      me, but said that the pain would moderate before morning, especially if
      the fish was dead. Had its fins struck into my foot instead of my hand I
      should have died, they asserted; and then they told the mate and myself
      that one day a mischievous boy who had speared one of these abominable
      fish threw it at a young woman who was standing some distance away. It
      struck her on the foot, the spines penetrating a vein, and the poor girl
      died in terrible agony on the following day. By midnight the pain I was
      enduring began to moderate, though my hand and arm were swollen to double
      the proper size, and a splitting headache kept me awake till daylight. The
      shock to the system affected me for quite a week afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      During many subsequent visits to the Marshall Group our crews were always
      cautioned by the people of the various islands about eating fish or
      shell-fish without submitting them to local examination. In the Radack
      chain of this widely spread out archipelago we found that the lagoons were
      comparatively free from poisonous fish, while the Ralick lagoons were
      infested with them, quite 30 per cent, being highly dangerous at all times
      of the year, and nearly 50 per cent at other seasons. Jaluit Lagoon was,
      and is now, notorious for its poisonous fish. It is a curious fact that
      fish of a species which you may eat with perfect safety, say, in the
      middle of the month, will be pronounced by the expert natives to be
      dangerous a couple of weeks later, and that in a &ldquo;school&rdquo; of pink rock
      bream numbering many hundreds some may have their poison highly developed,
      others in but a minor degree, whilst many may be absolutely free from the
      taint. In the year 1889 the crew of a large German ship anchored in one of
      the Marshall Islands caught some very large and handsome fish of the bream
      kind, and the resident natives pronounced them &ldquo;good.&rdquo; Three or four days
      later some more were taken, and the cook did not trouble to ask native
      opinion. The result was that eight or nine men were taken seriously ill,
      and for some time the lives of several were despaired of. Two of them had
      not recovered the use of their hands and feet at the end of ten weeks, and
      their faces, especially the eyes and mouth, seemed to be permanently,
      though slightly distorted. All the men agreed in one particular, that at
      midday they suffered most&mdash;agonising cramps, accompanied by shooting
      pains in the head and continuous vomiting to the point of exhaustion,
      these symptoms being very pronounced during the first week or eight days
      after the fish had been eaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      That kind-hearted and unfortunate officer, Commodore J. G. Goodenough,
      took an interest in the poisonous and stinging fish of the Pacific
      Islands, and one day showed me, preserved in spirits of wine, a specimen
      of the dreaded <i>no'u</i> fish of the Hervey Group&mdash;one of the most
      repulsive-looking creatures it is possible to imagine out of a child's
      fairy book. The deadly poison which this fish ejects is contained in a
      series of sacs at the base of the spines, and the commodore intended to
      submit it to an analyist. By a strange coincidence this gallant seaman a
      few months afterwards died from the effects of a poisoned arrow shot into
      his side by the natives of Nukapu, one of the Santa Cruz group of islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      This <i>no'u</i> however, which is the <i>nofu</i> of the Samoans, and is
      widely known throughout Polynesia, and Melanesia under different names,
      does not disguise its deadly character under a beautiful exterior like the
      stinging fish of Micronesia, which I have described above. The <i>nofu</i>
      which is also met with on the coasts of Australia, is a devil undisguised,
      and belongs to the angler family. Like the octopus or the death-adder (<i>Acanthopis
      antarctica</i>) of Australia, he can assimilate his colour to his
      environment. His hideous wrinkled head, with his staring goggle eyes, are
      often covered with fine wavy seaweed, which in full-grown specimens
      sometimes extends right down the back to the tail. From the top of the
      upper jaw, along the back and sides, are scores of needle-pointed spines,
      every one of which is a machine for the ejection of the venom contained at
      the root. As the creature lies hidden in a niche of coral awaiting its
      prey&mdash;it is a voracious feeder&mdash;it cannot be distinguished
      except by the most careful scrutiny; then you may see that under the
      softly waving and suspended piece of seaweed (as you imagine it to be)
      there are fins and a tail. And, as the <i>nofu</i> has a huge mouth, which
      is carefully concealed by a fringe of apparently harmless seaweed or other
      marine growth, he snaps up every unfortunate small fish which comes near
      him. In the Pacific Islands the <i>nofu</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;the waiting one
      &ldquo;) is generally a dark brown, inclining to black, with splashes or
      blotches of orange, or marbled red and grey. In Australian waters&mdash;I
      have caught them in the Parramatta river, Port Jackson&mdash;they are
      invariably either a dark brown or a horrid, dulled yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite its poison-injecting apparatus this fish is eaten by the natives
      of the Society, Hervey, and Paumotu groups of islands, in the South
      Pacific, where its flesh is considered a delicacy. It is prepared for
      cookery by being skinned, in which operation the venomous sacks are
      removed. In 1882, when I was living on the island of Peru in the Gilbert
      Group (the Francis Island of the Admiralty charts), a Chinese trader there
      constantly caught them in the lagoon and ate them in preference to any
      other fish. Here in Peru the <i>nofu</i> would bury itself in the soft
      sand and watch for its prey, and could always be taken with a hook. And
      yet in Eastern Polynesia and in the Equatorial Islands of the Pacific many
      deaths have occurred through the sting of this fish, children invariably
      succumbing to tetanus within twenty-four hours of being stung.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little more about poisonous fish, <i>i.e.</i>, fish which at one time of
      the year are good and palatable food and at others deadly. In the lagoon
      island of Nukufetau (the &ldquo;De Peyster Island&rdquo; of the charts), where the
      writer lived for twelve months, the fish both within the lagoon and
      outside the barrier reef became highly poisonous at certain times of the
      year. Flying-fish (which were never caught inside the lagoon) would be
      safe to eat if taken on the lee side of the island, dangerous, or at least
      doubtful, if taken on the weather side; <i>manini</i>, a small striped
      fish much relished by the natives, would be safe to eat if caught on the
      reef on the western side of the island, slightly poisonous if taken four
      miles away on the inside shore of the eastern islets encompassing the
      lagoon. Sharks captured outside the reef, if eaten, would produce symptoms
      of poisoning&mdash;vomiting, excessive purging, and tetanus in a modified
      form; if caught inside the reef and eaten no ill effects would follow.
      Crayfish on one side of the lagoon were safe; three miles away they were
      highly impregnated with this mysterious poison, the origin of which has
      not yet been well defined by scientists.
